# Avogadro web editor

A desktop-browser molecular editor with HTML controls around one Qt-backed
`GLWidget`. It discovers the installed Avogadro tool and display plugins and
uses Avogadro's molecular readers, writers, and undo transactions.
It does not create the desktop main window, menus, tool panels, or file dialogs.

## Run the CI build

1. Sign in to GitHub and [download the avogadro-web-wasm ZIP](https://github.com/OpenChemistry/avogadrolibs/actions/runs/43511417867/artifacts/14079587329).
   This ZIP expires on November 27, 2026. For newer builds, open a successful run
   from the [WASM Build workflow](https://github.com/OpenChemistry/avogadrolibs/actions/workflows/build_wasm.yml)
   and download **avogadro-web-wasm** from its **Artifacts** section.
2. Extract the ZIP and open a terminal in the extracted directory containing
   both `index.html` and `serve-wasm.py`. Keep the extracted files together.
3. Start the bundled server with Python 3:

   ```sh
   python3 serve-wasm.py
   ```

4. Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in a desktop browser.
   Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop the server.

The prebuilt package only needs Python 3 and a compatible browser. The bundled
server listens on loopback and sends the cross-origin isolation headers required
by the editor. Launch the editor through that server.

## Using the editor

The initial document is empty, with Draw active, carbon selected, automatic bond
order and hydrogen adjustment enabled. Draw by clicking or dragging; right-click
an atom or bond to remove it. Select by clicking or dragging a rectangle. Navigate
by dragging to rotate, right-dragging to pan, and scrolling to zoom. Ctrl/Cmd+Z,
Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z, Ctrl+Y, Delete and Backspace apply only in the viewport.

The WASM build also includes Measure, Manipulate, Align, Bond-Centric
Manipulation, and Edit Labels. Click atoms in the viewport to measure or align
them. Drag atoms with Manipulate, or pick a bond and right-drag one of its atoms
with Bond-Centric Manipulation to change its length. Edit Labels opens an HTML
input after you pick an atom. The display menu toggles Ball and Stick, Wireframe,
Licorice, Van der Waals, and Labels on the active layer. CJSON saves the enabled
styles per layer.

With the multithreaded Qt WASM build, **Calculations** offers Optimize
Geometry with UFF or Lennard-Jones, three molecular surfaces, and orbital
and electron-density isosurfaces. Select **Auto Optimize** in the toolbar
to run continuous optimization with Start and Stop. Open a Gaussian
formatted checkpoint (.fchk) or Molden file for orbital calculations, or
a Gaussian cube (.cube) to render an imported grid. Use **Display styles**
to show or hide the resulting surface.

CJSON is the default download format. MOL, SDF and XYZ are also supported. Open
parses into a temporary document; errors preserve the molecule and undo history.
Open and New clear history on success. Multi-record SDF and XYZ imports use the
first record with a visible notice. Replacing unsaved work requires an HTML
confirmation; leaving the page also requests browser confirmation. Only a CJSON
download clears the unsaved marker because other formats may omit properties.
A download request cannot prove that the user retained the file.

In browsers with WebMCP enabled, Avogadro registers the read-only
`inspect_molecule` tool. It returns atomic numbers, bond orders with zero-based
atom indices, counts, and the unsaved status of the live molecule. Inspection
runs in the tab and leaves the editor's undo stack and unsaved status intact.

Tablet gestures, notebooks, SMILES conversion, Python plugins, server-side
computation, and publishing are outside this milestone.

## Browser runtime and deployment

Keep `index.html`, `editor.css`, `editor.js`, `qtloader.js`, `avogadro-web.js`,
`avogadro-web.wasm`, and any generated `.data` or worker JavaScript files together.
CMake packages the loader installed with the selected Qt kit. Gzip is generated
when the host `gzip` utility is available. Do not mix loaders or runtimes from
another Qt build. The generated Qt demo HTML is not part of the release package.

The page calls the supported [`qtLoad` and container resize API](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/wasm.html#using-qtloader).
It requires WebAssembly, WebGL2, SharedArrayBuffer, a secure context (HTTPS or
localhost), and cross-origin isolation. A static host must send:

```text
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
```

Serve `.wasm` as `application/wasm`; add `Content-Encoding: gzip` only when
actually serving gzip bytes. A plain `python -m http.server` omits the isolation
headers and the editor will display an error. HTTPS hosting and publication are
not configured by this change.

## Interface

`WebController` owns the document and layer state and coordinates plugins,
transaction history, file operations and state notifications. All bindings run
on the Qt application thread, return values, and expose no C++ pointers.
`AvogadroEditor` in `editor.js` wraps the Embind instance:

- `setTool(id)` and `setDisplayStyle(id, enabled)` use IDs from `state.tools`
  and `state.displayStyles`
- `alignPickedAtoms('x' | 'y' | 'z')` and `setPickedLabel(label)` operate on
  picks in their respective tools
- `setDrawOptions({ atomicNumber: 1..118, bondOrder: 0..3, adjustHydrogens: bool, adjustBondLengths: bool })`
- `newMolecule()`, `loadMolecule(text, format)`, `exportMolecule(format = 'cjson')`
- `deleteSelection()`, `undo()`, `redo()`, `resetCamera()`
- `state` and `statechange` events containing tool, drawOptions, atomCount,
  bondCount, modified, canUndo, canRedo, pickedAtomIndex and pickedLabel

The Editor plugin owns its Draw options and publishes them through its command
interface and change signal. Its native QWidget panel is created on demand and
synchronizes in both directions. Browser code never creates or reads that panel.

## Automated browser checks

Tests use fresh profiles and never attach to a user's browser. Chromium's test
uses Node's built-in APIs. Firefox and startup-failure tests use `puppeteer-core`
(optionally located by `PUPPETEER_MODULE`). Firefox can run inside `xvfb-run` for
software rendering on Linux. See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) for the exact
commands and results from this implementation.

```sh
node avogadro-web/tests/browser-smoke.mjs http://127.0.0.1:8000 evidence/chromium
xvfb-run -a node avogadro-web/tests/firefox-smoke.mjs \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000 evidence/firefox
node avogadro-web/tests/startup-failures.mjs stage-web-new/share/avogadro-web
python3 avogadro-web/tests/check-build-profile.py build-web-new
```

To include the external `QWidget::update()` regression, build WASM with
`-DENABLE_TESTING=ON`, serve that build, and run:

```sh
node avogadro-web/tests/browser-smoke.mjs http://127.0.0.1:8000 evidence/widget-update --widget-update
```

For the tool and display tests, serve a WASM build made with
`-DENABLE_TESTING=ON` and run:

```sh
node avogadro-web/tests/browser-smoke.mjs http://127.0.0.1:8000 evidence/plugins --plugins
```


To include calculation checks in the Chrome run, set
`AVOGADRO_FCHK_FIXTURE` to the absolute path of
`avogadrodata/data/fchk/h2o-restricted.fchk` in the superbuild checkout.

## Build

Use a **fresh build directory and install prefix** for each profile. Reusing an
installation with more features can leave obsolete plugins and headers behind.
Run these commands from the OpenChemistry superbuild root, with its submodules
already available. Native examples assume CMake, Ninja and the selected Qt kit
are on the appropriate paths.

```sh
# Normal native defaults remain enabled.
cmake -S . -B build-native-new -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt/6.11.1/gcc_64
cmake --build build-native-new --parallel 4

# Native desktop without external processes or Python script plugins.
cmake -S . -B build-native-no-process-new -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt/6.11.1/gcc_64 \
  -DENABLE_SUBPROCESS=OFF
cmake --build build-native-no-process-new --parallel 4

# Qt 6.11.1 multithreaded WASM and Emscripten 4.0.7.
# Use the SDK's normal environment activation before configuring.
/path/to/Qt/6.11.1/wasm_multithread/bin/qt-cmake \
  -S . -B build-web-new -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DQT_HOST_PATH=/path/to/Qt/6.11.1/gcc_64
cmake --build build-web-new --parallel 4
# Stage the application into a separate, empty destination.
cmake --install build-web-new/avogadro-web --prefix "$PWD/stage-web-new"
cd stage-web-new/share/avogadro-web
python3 serve-wasm.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Stop the server with Ctrl+C. The server binds only to
loopback and serves its working directory. It sends the required isolation
headers and serves the optional precompressed WASM file when gzip is accepted.

Qt's WASM kit selects whether the build uses threads. For the browser release,
use the multithreaded kit and serve it with `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy:
same-origin` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`. These headers
enable cross-origin isolation and the `SharedArrayBuffer` used by Qt threads.
The current browser loader requires that isolation. The single-threaded kit
can be used to build the libraries without forcing `-pthread`.

`ENABLE_SUBPROCESS` defaults ON natively and OFF under Emscripten; it is separate
from `USE_PYTHON`, which builds Python API bindings. Its value is exported as
`AvogadroLibs_USE_SUBPROCESS` and through the native target definition
`AVOGADRO_USE_SUBPROCESS`. Disabled script/package APIs are not installed.

`AVOGADRO_WEB_EDITOR` defaults OFF natively and ON under Emscripten. This profile
requires subprocess, libarchive, plotting and desktop RPC to be OFF and static
plugins to be ON. WASM requires static libraries and no Python bindings.
Incompatible explicit requests fail configuration rather than being silently
forced off. Native code tests use `ENABLE_TESTING=ON`; browser tests execute the
WASM release. The superbuild maps `ENABLE_SUBPROCESS` to the library option `USE_SUBPROCESS`.

For a native version of the same web controller and its tests, build
avogadrolibs with `USE_SUBPROCESS=OFF`, `USE_LIBARCHIVE=OFF`,
`USE_PLOTTER=OFF` and `BUILD_STATIC_PLUGINS=ON`, then build this repository
against that installation. The native executable is useful for debugging; the HTML
interface is delivered only by the WASM package. Set `ENABLE_TESTING=ON` on both
projects and provide GoogleTest. Run `ctest --test-dir <web-build>` and the
Core/Io/QtGui/Rendering suites in the libraries build.

## Standalone build

This repository owns the web executable, controller, browser assets and tests.
The desktop application remains in `avogadroapp`; the rendering and molecular
libraries remain in `avogadrolibs`. The superbuild selects `avogadro-web` when
`AVOGADRO_WEB_EDITOR=ON` and `avogadroapp` otherwise.

To build this repository directly against an installed web-profile library:

```sh
cmake -S avogadro-web -B build-web-controller -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/web-profile/prefix;/path/to/Qt/6.11.1/gcc_64" \
  -DENABLE_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build-web-controller --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build-web-controller --output-on-failure
```

For WASM, configure this repository with `qt-cmake` from the WASM Qt kit and
point `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` and `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH` at the matching WASM
Avogadro library installation. Use a fresh build directory. No source files or CMake modules from `avogadroapp` are needed.
